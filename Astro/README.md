# Astro

**Astro** is a small and simple **Lua** library.

## Features

- Table concatenation with format support and cycle detection.

- String manipulation:
    - Character substring extraction.
    - Blank or empty strings checks.
    - Check if ends or starts with another sequence.

- Table manipulation:
    - Operations such as addition, substraction, merging and reversing, etc.
    - Functions to retrieve, find and filter keys and values in different ways.
    - Shallow and deep copy functions.
    - Function to make a table read-only.

The table library attempts to preserve the original metatable and metamethods from the input table.

**Astro** looks forward to extend the standard Lua library with a wide range of utilities to keep the code **simple and readable**.
