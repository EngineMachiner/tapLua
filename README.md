# tapLua

**tapLua** is a **Lua scripting** library for **StepMania and OutFox** developers.
It features functions for actors, colors, file management, vectors and object type checking. It also includes [**Astro**](https://github.com/EngineMachiner/Astro) and some sprite actors.

tapLua focuses to be compatible with newer game builds, so it may not be compatible with older versions.

It is also used in some of my other StepMania projects.

## Usage

### OutFox

  1. Clone in the fallback's Modules folder.
  2. Load it using LoadModule("tapLua/tapLua.lua") once.

### Legacy

  1. Clone in the Scripts folder.
