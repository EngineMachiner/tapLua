# tapLua

tapLua is a library I made with basic functions that I use in some of my projects based for OutFox or StepMania.

tapLua has been tested through from StepMania 5.0.12 to 5.3 / OutFox.

## Usage

1. Copy the tapLua folder to fallback's Modules folder.
2. Load tapLua.lua using LoadModule() on the initial fallback screen.
